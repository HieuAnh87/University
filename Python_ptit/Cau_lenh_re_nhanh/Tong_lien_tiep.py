# Approach: The idea is to represent N as a sequence of length L+1 as: 
# N = a + (a+1) + (a+2) + .. + (a+L) 
# => N = (L+1)*a + (L*(L+1))/2 
# => a = (N- L*(L+1)/2)/(L+1) 
# We substitute the values of L starting from 1 till L*(L+1)/2 < N 
# If we get ‘a’ as a natural number then the solution should be counted.
